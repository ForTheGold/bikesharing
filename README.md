## Background

Reflecting on my travels throughout New York City, I came to the realization that one of the reasons that the travel experience was so enjoyable was because of an unexpected company that I ran into there called CitiBike.  CitiBike is a bike sharing company that has bikes around the city that users can rent through a phone application.  You can then return them at different locations than you picked them up from which is what makes the company so cool.  A traveler can get through a great deal of the city due to the easy accessibility of bikes throughout the city, and commuters seem to be using them to get to and from as well.

## Purpose

It dawned on me that this is a pretty good business idea that could be applied to a variety of other cities with high population density and a decent number of travelers.  I also decided to look into whether or not this same concept could be used in smaller cities with a change to the mechanics of the company.  This analysis is looking to the viability of applying the concept to Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

Here is the presentation that I was able to come up with using Tableau.



The first figure shows us that nearly all of the users use the bikes for less than one hour.  It may be possible to encourage them to go a little longer with discount deals on multiple hours at a time, and we may consider a one hour minimum for the use of the bikes.



The second table simply shows us that men tend to rent bikes more than women, but both sexes do so for a similar duration.  It may be useful to allocate the advertising budget accordingly.



It seems that a large number of the rentals on weekdays are coming from commutes as the peak hours are six to nine in the morning and four to seven in the evening.  The rentals are much more balanced on the weekends which seems to indicate they are more used for leisure than commute.



There is no sex differential with the aforementioned pattern.



A large number of the users are subscribers which indicates that they are likely residents of New York City and the surrounding area rather than travelers.



Bikes are much more commonly used in heavily trafficked areas, particularly Manhattan, than just about anywhere else.



Most bikes appear to be left in these same areas as well.  This means that transportation costs for relocating bikes are not likely to be prohibitively high.



Most users are young.  There is a spike in users born after 1995.



Some bikes are used a great deal more than others.  The lesser used bikes could be relocated during repairs and replacements of the more heavily used bikes.



Most bikes are used for generally the same duration.  Although some are used more than others.

## Summary

It seems that the business would be viable in a smaller city as long as there are a decent number of residents who are able to commute from home to work by bike.  If there is a good amount of housing within biking distance from the business and financial district would be the next step to research for Des Moines as well as any other city that we plan to launch.  It seems that getting subscribers is the key to success with this business plan.
